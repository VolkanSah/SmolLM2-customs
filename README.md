# SmolLM2 Customs — Build Your Own LLM Service

> A showcase: how to build a free, private, OpenAI-compatible LLM service on HuggingFace Spaces and plug it into any hub or application — no GPU, no money, no drama.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under active development — always use the latest release from [Codey Lab](https://github.com/Codey-LAB/SmolLM2-customs) *(more stable builds land there first)*.
> This repo ([DEV-STATUS](https://github.com/VolkanSah/SmolLM2-custom)) is where the chaos happens. 🔬 A ⭐ on the repos would be cool 😙

## What is this?

A minimal but production-ready LLM service built on:

- **SmolLM2-360M-Instruct** — 269MB, Apache 2.0, minimum runs on 2 CPUs and ~2GB RAM for free  (basic cuda -> fallback -> cpu)
- **FastAPI** — OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- **ADI** (Anti-Dump Index) — filters low-quality requests before AND after inference
- **HF Dataset** — logs every request automatically for later finetuning
- **GitHub Actions** — one-click remote training pipeline, no SSH required

The point is not the model — the point is the pattern. Fork it, swap SmolLM2 for any model you want, and you have your own private LLM API running for free.

## The Real Use Case: AI for Broke Admins 💀

This isn't built to replace ChatGPT or to impress investors.

It's built because after years of Linux/security work you accumulate ~1984 commands in your head — and keeping them all sharp gets harder over time. The goal is a **small, private, terminal-drilled assistant** that:

- Knows your exact workflows — not generic tutorials
- Runs on a 2010 ThinkPad X201 with 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM
- Works fully offline when needed
- Doesn't explain things you already know — just outputs the command
- Gets smarter the more you use it, because every request feeds the training loop

Not a chatbot. Not an AI agent. A **drilled assistant** — trained on your own work, your own tools, your own patterns.

```
You:  "local pcap capture"
Hub: tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
             tshark -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

You:  "nmap stealth syn scan"
Hub: nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

You:  "c2 jitter detection wireshark"
Hub: dns && frame.time_delta
             frame.time_delta.stddev < 0.05 → automated behavior
```

No preamble. No explanation. Just the tool.

## Why ADI? The Anti-Bullshit Filter Every LLM Needs

This is the part most LLM projects skip — and it's the part that matters most for training quality.

Every request that hits the service gets scored by the **Anti-Dump Index (ADI)** — before inference and after. The idea is simple: garbage in, garbage out. If you train a model on low-quality interactions, you get a low-quality model. ADI exists to break that cycle.

**What ADI filters out:**
- Vague, meaningless, or incomplete requests ("tell me something", "help", "?")
- Prompt injection attempts and jailbreak patterns
- Requests with no actionable signal — things that would produce useless training data even if answered correctly

**What ADI lets through:**
- Specific, well-formed requests with clear intent
- Anything that would actually produce a useful training example

**Why this matters for training:**

Every interaction that passes ADI gets logged to a private HF dataset. When you trigger the training pipeline, ADI filters the dataset again — REJECT entries are skipped, only clean interactions feed the fine-tuner. The result is a model that keeps getting better at exactly what you actually use it for, without accumulating noise.

```
Request → ADI scores input
              ↓
         REJECT → logged (skipped at training time)
         PASS   → SmolLM2 answers → ADI scores output
                      ↓
                 logged to dataset (used at training time)
```

The ADI implementation here is minimal — built for this showcase. But the concept scales. Any model, any domain. You define what "quality" means for your use case, ADI enforces it, and your training data stays clean automatically.

This is not a new idea. It's just rarely done at the data-collection layer. Most projects filter after the fact, manually, if at all. Here it's built into the loop from day one.

## Ethics & Intent — No Profit, No Scam, No Exceptions

This project was built to learn and to share — nothing else.

It is not built for profit. It is not built to enable scams, illegal activity, or any kind of harm — legal or not. The [ESOL license](ESOL) is not decoration; it is a hard constraint on how this software may be used.

The security focus (ADI filtering, auth hardening, rate limiting) exists because the author spent years working in Linux and security environments. These are not features added to look serious — they reflect how production systems actually need to be built.

If you fork this: use it to learn, use it to build something honest, use it to understand how LLM services work under the hood. That's what it's here for.

---

## How it works

```
Request
    ↓
ADI Score (input quality check)
    ↓
REJECT        → returns improvement suggestions, logs to dataset
MEDIUM/HIGH   → SmolLM2 answers, ADI scores the output too
SmolLM2 fails → 503 → hub fallback chain kicks in (gemini, openrouter, ...)
    ↓
Response logged to private HF Dataset (Parquet)
    ↓
You trigger GitHub Actions when ready → training pipeline runs
    ↓
Finetuned weights pushed to private model repo
    ↓
Next Space restart loads your model automatically
```

---

## The Training Loop — GitHub Actions

This is the actual clue of the whole setup. Every interaction gets logged. When you have enough data, one click in GitHub Actions kicks off the full pipeline — no SSH, no HF UI, no manual work:

```
[GitHub Actions — workflow_dispatch]
        │
        ├── mode: export
        │     └── dumps HF dataset → /tmp/train_data.jsonl
        │         (filtered: REJECT entries skipped, BLOCKED included)
        │         server keeps running, data waits in /tmp/
        │
        ├── mode: validate          ← optional
        │     └── checks ADI weight accuracy against labeled data
        │         useful if you manually edited the CSV via Parquet-Sync
        │
        ├── mode: finetune
        │     └── TRL SFTTrainer on CPU (batch=1, grad_accum=4)
        │         → saves to /tmp/finetuned_model
        │         → pushes weights to your private HF model repo
        │         → updates model card automatically
        │
        └── mode: all / export_validate
              └── runs steps sequentially in one pipeline run
```

**The workflow is safe by design:**
- `workflow_dispatch` only — only you can trigger it (Write access required)
- Concurrency guard — no parallel training runs, ever
- Retry with exponential backoff — HF Spaces wake up slowly sometimes
- Dry-run mode — prints curl commands without executing, for testing
- 4xx → immediate abort, no pointless retries on auth errors
- Full pipeline summary in GitHub Actions UI after every run

```yaml
# .github/workflows/smollm2-training.yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      mode:
        type: choice
        options: [all, export, validate, finetune, export_validate]
      dry_run:
        type: boolean
```

**The typical workflow:**

```
1. Use the service → requests get logged automatically
2. Check your HF dataset → review what was logged
3. Edit CSV if needed via Parquet-Sync (fix responses, add labels)
4. GitHub Actions → export → (validate) → finetune
5. Space restarts → loads your finetuned model
6. Repeat
```

Or skip to `finetune` directly if you already exported and edited manually — the pipeline is flexible.

## Endpoints

```
GET  /                        → status
GET  /v1/health               → health check (auth required)
POST /v1/chat/completions     → OpenAI-compatible inference
POST /v1/train/execute?mode=  → remote training trigger
                                 mode: export | validate | finetune (trigger over git, too)
```

---

## Plug into any Hub

Works out of the box with my [AI HUB](https://github.com/VolkanSah/Multi-LLM-API-Gateway):

```ini
[LLM_PROVIDER.smollm]
active        = "true"
base_url      = "https://YOUR-USERNAME-smollm2-customs.hf.space/v1"
env_key       = "SMOLLM_API_KEY"
default_model = "smollm2-360m"
models        = "smollm2-360m, YOUR-USERNAME/your-finetuned-model"
fallback_to   = "gemini"
[LLM_PROVIDER.smollm_END]
```

Any OpenAI-compatible client works the same way.

## Secrets (HF Space Settings)

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `SMOLLM_API_KEY` | recommended | Locks the endpoint — set same value in your hub and GitHub Secret |
| `HF_TOKEN` or `TEST_TOKEN` | optional | HF auth for dataset + model repo access |
| `MODEL_REPO` | optional | Base model override (default: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct`) |
| `DATASET_REPO` | optional | Your private HF dataset for logging |
| `PRIVATE_MODEL_REPO` | optional | Your private model repo for finetuned weights |

**GitHub Secret needed for Actions:**
```
Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
Name: SMOLLM_API_KEY
Value: same as your HF Space secret
```

**Auth modes:**
```
SMOLLM_API_KEY not set  → open access (demo/showcase mode)
SMOLLM_API_KEY set      → protected (production mode)
Space private           → double protection (HF gate + your key)
```

---

## ADI Routing

ADI runs **twice** — on input and on output. Low-quality requests never reach the model. Low-quality responses never reach the user.

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `HIGH_PRIORITY` | SmolLM2 handles it |
| `MEDIUM_PRIORITY` | SmolLM2 handles it |
| `REJECT` | Returns improvement suggestions, logs to dataset |
| `BLOCKED` | Hard block — dangerous/unauthorized patterns |
| SmolLM2 fails | 503 → hub fallback chain |

---

## Hardware Reality

```
HF Space (free tier):   2 CPU  /  2-3 GB RAM  → inference + training (till 9 GB by my tests)
ThinkPad X201 (2010):   4 CPU  /  8 GB RAM    → local deployment

```
